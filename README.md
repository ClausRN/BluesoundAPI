## Development

Very much work in progress at this time.
Much of the work decoding the http api is done by these two guys. A big thank you to them.

## Endpoint API

Discovery returns a service on port 11100, a look at the node 2 diagnostic output from the app, and some wireshark runs, show this is a HTTP service. Endpoints seem to return xml, or image binary data, and support gzip compression. It unfortuantly doesn't use HTTP all that well [GETs that have side-effects, lack of useful caching headers], no doubt leading to the artwork caching problems in the desktop app.

* /SyncStatus returns high level info about the device, e.g.

    curl <http://192.168.1.45:11000/SyncStatus>

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
    <SyncStatus icon="/images/players/N110_nt.png"
                volume="-1"
                modelName="NODE 2"
                name="Cave"
                model="N110"
                brand="Bluesound"
                etag="3"
                schemaVersion="15"
                syncStat="3"
                id="192.168.1.45:11000"
                mac="90:56:82:3F:AA:A0">
    </SyncStatus>
    ```

* /Status returns detailed information about what the device is currently doing

    curl <http://192.168.1.45:11000/Status>

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
    <status etag="ab5306d5f830e473252a22f5102df62d">
        <album>John Digweed Live in London</album>
        <artist>Phonogenic</artist>

        <state>play</state>
        <syncStat>3</syncStat>
        <title1>Tired Being</title1>
        <title2>Phonogenic</title2>
        <title3>John Digweed Live in London</title3>
        <totlen>170</totlen>
        <volume>-1</volume>
        <secs>6</secs>
    </status>
    ```

    this also takes an etag querystring param, and timeout value [not an HTTP header], this appears to provide a blocking get until there's a status change.

    curl "<http://192.168.1.45:11000/Status?etag=1117370c37d450a8322e05f51358a0a4&timeout=60>"

* /Play & /Pause will cause the player to start or stop the current play queue, it returns the new state of the player

    curl <http://192.168.1.45:11000/Play>

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
    <state>play</state>
    ```

    specifying an ID parameter will change the song being played, id appears to be a zero based index into the play queue.

    curl <http://192.168.1.45:11000/Play?id=2>

* /Back and /Skip will go backward or forward one track.

* /Shuffle?state=1 turns shuffle on, state=0 turns it off.

* /Repeat?state=0|1|2 where 2 = no repeat, 1= repeat 1, 0 = repeat all

* /Services returns details about the available sources for node, local library, internet radio services etc, this would seem to drive the main part of the UI.

* /Presets

* /GitVersion returns the version of the software on the devices? (this returns 2.8.3 for my node 2)

* /Playlist returns the Play Queue

* /Clear deletes all the play queue entries

* /Delete?id=x deletes an entry from the play queue, id is the zero offset into the play queue.

* /Songs returns more detailed information about an album e.g.

    /Songs?service=LocalMusic&album=Waiting%20for%20the%20Sirens%27%20Call&artist=New%20Order

returns

```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
    <songs service="LocalMusic" id="13">
        <album time="3804" quality="cd">
        <song>
            <track>1</track>
            <discno>1/1</discno>
            <title>Who's Joe?</title>
            <art>New Order</art>
            <alb>Waiting for the Sirens' Call</alb>
            <composer>New Order</composer>
            <fn>/var/mnt/ANDROMEDA-music/iTunes/Music/New Order/Waiting For The Sirens' Call/01 Who's Joe_.m4a</fn>
            <time>344</time>
            <date>2005</date>
            <quality>cd</quality>
        </song>
    <song>
```

* /Add adds items to the play queue and starts them, e.g.

    Play Now
        /Add?playnow=1&where=nextAlbum&service=LocalMusic&album=%2A%2A%2Ak%20the%20Millenium&artist=The%20KLF

    Add Next
        /Add?playnow=-1&where=nextAlbum&service=LocalMusic&album=Vs.%20T-World%20-%202000&artist=GusGus

    Play Last
        /Add?playnow=-1&where=last&service=LocalMusic&album=Waiting%20for%20the%20Rights%20of%20Mu&artist=The%20KLF

* /Artwork returns the cover artwork for a specified album/artist,

    GET /Artwork?service=LocalMusic&album=10%20Years%20%5BDisc%202%5D&artist=Banco%20De%20Gaia
